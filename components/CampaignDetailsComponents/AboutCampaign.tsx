			The Project for Awesome is a once-a-year charity event that combines
			community-created videos promoting nonprofits, a 48 hour livestream with
			celebrity guests & charities. John & Hank, along with a number of special
			guests, host a 48-hour continuous livestream to feature videos, announce
			new perks, put peanut butter on their faces, throw confetti, and do their
			happy dances. You truly never know what will happen, so tune in, join the
			party, and help us decrease world suck!
